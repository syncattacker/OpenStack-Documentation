## Command Briefing

`echo "stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/stack`

> `echo` returns output as `stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` <br />

> `stack` refers the user created <br />

> `ALL:(ALL)` means stack is allowed to run commands as any user. <br />
> So, if the user stack wants to run a command as another user (like root, or any other user on the system), they can do so. Normally, a user can only run commands as themselves, but this allows stack to act as any user. <br />

> `| (PIPE)` takes the output of echo and passes it as input to the next command `sudo tee` in this case. <br />

> `sudo` getting administrative privileges. <br />

> `tee` reads from the standard input (in this case output by the echo command) and writes it to the file specified `/etc/sudoers.d/stack` <br /> <br />

`sudo -u stack -i`

> `sudo` run command as another user (default superuser).

> `-u stack` user you want to switch to, stack in this case.

> `-i` open interactive shell. <br />
